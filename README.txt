This is my Maps project. I started it for a class in iOS programming. It is a compilation of
my collection of scenic maps. Each map has a geographic scene on the cover. These scenes are
geocoded. The maps can be accessed through a list titled geographic locations (cities,
states) or through MapKit pins keyed to the scenes (Glacier National Park, Liberty Bell).

This is an update to the original project. The updates are:
- It includes scans of my own map collection (175+ maps)
- It uses different color map pins for the various user choices

This is still configured for iOS 5 and 6. If you wish to compile it for iOS 7, you may need
to turn on Auto Layout and some other features that are not supported in iOS 5.

Thanks,
Mark
